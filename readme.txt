I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause15

I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Teach Pokemon to understand

Pokemon! Gotta catch 'em all
It's you and me
I know it's my destiny
Pokemon! Oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend

I wanna be the very best

To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause15

I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Teach Pokemon to understand
The power that's inside2

Pokemon! Gotta catch 'em all
It's you and me
I know it's my destiny
Pokemon! Oh, you're my best friend
